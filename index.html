      <h2>A website about Clementine Kruczynski's Hair Journey in <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em></h2>

        <p><em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> is a 2005 film starring Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey (for more on about the film, visit About). One of the most memorable aspects of the film is Kate Winslet's character, Clementine Kruczynski, ever-changing hair color.</p>
        <p>The film's time-line jumps around and Clementine's hair color jumps around with it, making it a bit difficult to comprehend when in the storyline she had a specific hair color.</p>
