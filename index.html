      <h2>A website about Clementine Kruczynski's Hair Journey in <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em></h2>

        <p><em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> is a 2004 film starring Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey (for more about the film, visit <a href="about.html">About</a>). One of the most memorable aspects of the film is Clementine Kruczynski's (Kate Winslet) ever-changing hair color.</p>
        <p>The film's time-line jumps around and Clementine's hair color jumps around with it, making it a bit difficult to comprehend when in the storyline she had a specific hair color. Your confusion ends here. </p>

      <p>
        Although we do not find out until the end of the film, Clementine's hair was green when she first met Joel. We find out from Clementine that the dye's name is "Green Revolution."

      <h3>Red in Love</h3>

        <p>
        Clementine's hair is red when she and Joel first start dating. Is it a coincidence that red happens to be Clementine's hair color when they are in the "honeymoon" phase of their relationship?

      <h3>Agent Orange</h3>
        <img src="Kate_Winslet_Orange_Hair.png" alt="Clementine with Orange Hair"/>
        <p>Clementine dyes her hair orange while she is still with Joel. She dyes is to match her favorite sweatshirt (pictured above with green hair). Joel gives her the nickname Tangerine. Although they are still together and in love, it is while she has orange hair that the relationship begins to fall apart.</p>

      <h3>Blue Ruin</h3>
        <img src="Kate_Winslet_Blue_Hair.png" alt="Clementine with Blue Hair"/>
        <p>When Joel first meets Clementine in the beginning of the film, she has blue hair. Clementine, however, dyes her hair blue after her separation from Joel and after she erases him from her memory. What we witness is their second "first meeting".  During that encounter, Clementine reveals to Joel the dye's name is "Blue Ruin".</p>
